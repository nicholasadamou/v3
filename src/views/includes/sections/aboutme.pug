                .subtitle Hey, I am Nicholas Adamou, I am a Computer Science student at 
                    em Hartwick College
                    |. My goal is to learn as much as I can about different areas of the computer. I absolutely love programming. The mere ability to write a few lines of code and have something unique and interesting come up on the screen fascinates me every day!
                .subtitle However, that's not the only thing that interests me, I also love tennis! I have been a tennis player for as long as I can remember, but to be more specific, I picked up the racket for the first time when I was 12 years old. Since then, a lot has changed with my game. My favorite tennis player and role model for my own game is 
                    em Rafael Nadal of Spain
                    |. He is a lefty, like me. What I admire about him is his dedication to the game and his extreme work ethic. He is a great role model for hard work in almost anything you do in life.
